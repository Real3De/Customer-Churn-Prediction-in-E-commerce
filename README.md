Challenges:
Limited dataset size
Potential imbalance in churn/non-churn classes
Lack of explicit churn label (likely to be inferred)
Reliance on available features without additional data



Obtaining Churn Information in  Dataset
Understanding the Challenge
The primary challenge in this scenario is that the dataset doesn't explicitly contain a "churn" column. Therefor infer churn based on available data.
 Churn Defination
Factors and elements that constitutes a "churned" customer in the context of  e-commerce business. Common definitions include:
Incorporating Multiple Churn Indicators ( in future version )
1. Purchase Frequency Decline:
Calculate average purchase frequency per customer over a specific period.
Compare recent purchase frequency to historical average.
Set a threshold for a significant decline to indicate potential churn.
2. Purchase Amount Reduction:
Calculate average purchase amount per customer.
Compare recent purchase amounts to historical average.
Establish a threshold for a substantial decrease to signal churn risk.
3. Product Category Shift:
Analyze changes in product categories purchased by customers.
Identify significant shifts away from core product lines as a potential churn indicator.
4. Promotion Usage Changes:
Examine changes in promotion usage patterns.
A decrease in promotion responsiveness might suggest declining interest.
5. Satisfaction Score Deterioration:
Track changes in satisfaction scores over time.
A consistent decline could indicate growing dissatisfaction and potential churn.
Combining Indicators for a Comprehensive Churn Flag
By incorporating these additional factors,  can create a more nuanced churn definition. On top of this  assign weights to different indicators based on their relative importance to your business. However for this simplify version we base on direct conversion of purchase_frequency to determine churn which might be oversimplify the business goal but its my first attempt to create streamline process of ML system for experience prepare for the next version through agile iteration to take place.

Creating a Churn Flag ( future version draft plan )
Definition of churn, will lead to creation of a new column in  Data Frame to indicate whether a customer has churned. This column will be of boolean data type (True/False or 1/0).
  
import pandas as pd

# Assuming you have a DataFrame named 'data'

# Define churn based on no purchase for 6 months
churn_threshold = 180  # Adjust based on your business definition

# Calculate the last purchase date for each customer
data['last_purchase_date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['purchase_date'])  # Assuming 'purchase_date' exists
data['days_since_last_purchase'] = (pd.to_datetime('today') - data['last_purchase_date']).dt.days

# Create a churn flag
data['churn'] = data['days_since_last_purchase'] >= churn_threshold
 
Incorporating Churn into the Model
This newly created churn column will be the target variable for the machine learning model. The production operators will use it to train a classifier to predict churn for new or existing customers.
Considerations
Data Quality: Ensure the accuracy and completeness of purchase data to avoid misleading churn calculations. 
Time Period: The chosen timeframe for defining churn should align with business's customer lifecycle and retention goals. 
Customer Lifecycle: Consider factors like customer acquisition date and product lifetime when defining churn. 
Data Imbalance: If the dataset is heavily skewed towards non-churned customers,  need to address class imbalance using techniques like oversampling with SMOTE

With those concept in mind,  effectively extract churn information from given dataset and proceed with building a churn prediction model.




Data Visualization Charting 
Data visualization is key to unlocking the hidden stories within our data. Some key visualizations that provide valuable insights into customer behavior and churn patterns by refer to all charting in our presentation slide. My juypter notebook contain those description and insight for each chart for further analysis and insight. Its contains all charting and detail discovery in full details.

By visualizing our data, we can identify trends, patterns, and correlations relationship that would otherwise it will be difficult to uncover. These insights empower us to make data-driven decisions and develop targeted retention strategies."

ML has the potential to revolutionize customer retention in e-commerce by accurately predicting churn and enabling targeted interventions. However, it is essential to prioritize ethical considerations and responsible AI practices to build trust with customers and protect their interests. By adopting a proactive approach to AI governance, e-commerce businesses can harness the power of ML while mitigating risks and ensuring a positive customer experience.

Example: A leading e-commerce retailer successfully implemented a ML-based churn prediction model, resulting in a 20% reduction in customer churn within six months. The company prioritized data privacy, fairness, and transparency, leading to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

By following ethical guidelines and implementing effective governance practices, e-commerce businesses can leverage ML to drive customer retention and achieve sustainable growth.
Machine learning offers powerful tools for predicting and mitigating customer churn in e-commerce. However, to harness these benefits responsibly, businesses must prioritize ethical considerations and governance. By doing so, they can build trust with customers, comply with regulations, and ultimately achieve sustainable growth.



 


Discovery for further improvement  - version 2 

Data collection content can be richer perhaps 2 sets of datasets to formalize more robust and meaningful data frame functionality constitute to more higher accuracy of machine learning.   
AI model initial setup and creation or even Architecture and Design require over hall reinvention of definition of churn algorithm there by affecting newer model and selection decision. The newer model must be able to incorporate factors affecting churn decision making in order for business to benefit, ability for efficiency and effective work flow and build in flexibility even advance ( UI ) user interface to identify churn boolean probability. 
Visualization charting : focus on business prospective will aid generate more insight and business intelligence analysis and decision making other then inspiration of new innovative ideas. 

There by lead to my second proposal of introducing flexibility of threshold setting and parameters optional setup, allowing changes and additional setting besides anomaly detection to alert ML system churn signal. With combination of role-base and advance algorithm AI model to construct even higher accurate AI/ML model for predictions.

Augmented AI together with human in research and development process is proven very effective and productive, look promising to advance technological in high demand market environment. 
During ML course I personally invented another confusion matrix perhaps could lead to multiple of them to form tool box in future, I will keep on develop the above ideas to realizes it. At the moment, its inconvenience and unready to reveal any information further. The algorithm is tested workable. 
After this course if I could obtain any scholarship or sponsorship for my further study in AI/ML in master degree I will treasure it. Otherwise, I would have to look out for jobs in market, weather its AI/ML related is an optional or enter into internship to gain real life experience in startup.
